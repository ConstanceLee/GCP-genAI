    "    \"Typhoon Phanfone has killed at least one person, a US airman on Okinawa who was washed away by high waves. Thousands of households have lost power and Japan's two largest airlines have suspended many flights. The storm also forced the suspension of the search for people missing after last week's volcanic eruption. The storm-tracking website Tropical Storm Risk forecasts that Phanfone will rapidly lose power over the next few hours as it goes further into the Pacific Ocean. Typhoon Phanfone was downgraded from an earlier status of a super typhoon, but the Japan Meteorological Agency had warned it was still a dangerous storm. Japan averages 11 typhoons a year, according to its weather agency. The typhoon made landfall on Monday morning near the central city of Hamamatsu, with winds of up to 180 km/h (112 mph). The airman was one of three US military personnel swept away by high waves whipped up by the typhoon off southern Okinawa island, where the US has a large military base. The remaining two are still missing. A police spokesman said they had been taking photographs of the sea. A university student who was surfing off the seas of Kanagawa Prefecture, south of Tokyo, was also missing, national broadcast NHK reports. It said at least 10 people had been injured and 9,500 houses were without power. The storm was expected to deposit about 100mm of rain on Tokyo over 24 hours, according to the Transport Ministry website. Many schools were closed on Monday and two car companies in Japan halted production at some plants ahead of the storm. More than 174 domestic flights were affected nationwide, NHK state broadcaster said on Sunday. On Sunday, heavy rain delayed the Japanese Formula One Grand Prix in Suzaka. French driver Jules Bianchi lost control in the wet conditions and crashed, sustaining a severe head injury.\",\n",

There was another fire at the building 20 years ago, after which fire-proof foil was placed under the thatch, which is protecting the main building.

GMP said he had gone to Manchester Royal Infirmary and his condition was \"serious\". Principal Jenny Langley said the school would remain \"fully open\" while police investigated. \"Our thoughts are with the family and we\\'re doing everything we can to support them along with staff and pupils,\" she said.',\n",
    "    'But Belgian-born Dutchman Max Verstappen was unable to drive a car legally on his own in either country. That all changed on Wednesday when the youngster turned 18 and passed his driving test at the first attempt. Despite having competed in 14 grands prix since his debut in Australia in March, Verstappen admitted to feeling the pressure during his test. \"It\\'s a relief,\" said the Toro Rosso driver, who finished ninth in Japan on Sunday and had only started driving lessons a week ago. \"I was a bit nervous to make mistakes, but the exam went well.\" A bonus of turning 18 is that Verstappen will now be able to drink the champagne if he ever makes it onto the podium.',\n",
